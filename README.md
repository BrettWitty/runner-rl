Game Prototype: a cyberpunk roguelike of stealth, hacking and evil megacorps

At the moment there is:

A level generator:
It produces levels as abstract tree of rooms at different tiers. The player starts on 
the outermost tier of the tree and moves towards a central 'goal room' which will enable 
placement of progressively strong enemies, items and key finding 'puzzles.

The outer tiers are interconnected via airducts to mix up the boring tree structure.
